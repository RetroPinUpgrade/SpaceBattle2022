# SpaceBattle2022
New rules for a classic machine
  
## Installation Notes  
Since developing this code, my libraries have changed and I no longer have access to a machine for testing. If you find any errors, please contact me through pinballrefresh.com and I'll take a look.  
  
This code requires an RPU board version 101 or greater (CPU interposer board). For information on building/ordering a board, there are schematics and Gerber files here:  https://github.com/RetroPinUpgrade/ExampleMachine/tree/main/Schematics  
  
Build an RPU board 101 or greater, get an Arduino MEGA 2560 Pro, and optionally get a WAV Trigger for audio.  
  
Put all of the code here in a folder called SpaceBattle2022 and then build/load the code onto the Arduino MEGA 2560 Pro. The new code will boot automatically in the machine. Hold the Credit/Reset button as you power on the machine in order to boot to the original code.
